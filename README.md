## INSTALL

No need for any installation. Just note that when the script is not running as admin, certain programs like Task Manager disable your Hotkeys while focused.

<br>
<br>

## CUSTOMIZE

To adjust some other settings after the initial startup, click the task tray icon.

<h3>Autostart</h3>

Use the settings checkbox "Run at startup". You will be asked what startup mode you want.

Elevated startup runs the script earlier and enables you to move any window, even stuff like Task Manager.

<br>

<h3>Task View Login Prompt</h3>

To disable the Microsoft account login prompt in task view you get when you're using a local account on your machine, use the registry files in this folder.
